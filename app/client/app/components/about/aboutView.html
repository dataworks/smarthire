        <h2 class="page-header text-center" id="goal">Purpose</h2>
        <p id="about">Data Works has chosen the five of us as interns to come in and try and improve a real world process. This started as a way to help Data Works go through the hundreds of resumes that they receive every year for the internship program, but we hope that we have created something that can do a little more than that.  The process of going through all the resumes that were submitted to any company is a long and tedious process, and sometimes in the end there are one or two amazing candidates.  Well we have come up with a way to cut this time down to almost nothing!</p>
        <h2 class="page-header text-center" id="goal">Overview</h2>
        <p id="about">Over the period of nine weeks, we have come up with an application that will make going through resumes and finding the best applicants as simple as clicking a few buttons.  SmartHire will take in all of the resumes that a company receives over time, read through all of them, and assign each applicant a score.  This score is based on a machine learning algorithm that builds a profile of an ideal candidate based on the user's selections. Using this score, the user can easily get an idea of whether or not the individual would be a good fit for the company.  Along with the score, our application will go through the resume and pull out the applicant's name, school, GPA, degree, contact information, skills, links, and current position to help give a brief overview of the person.</p>

        <h2 class="page-header text-center" id="goal">Technology</h2>
        <p id="about">These past nine weeks have allowed us to learn so much, and we have all come so far in our understandings of the different types of technologies that are used in the working world. We have used Spark, ElasticSearch, Apache Tika, Apache OpenNLP, MLlib, AWS S3/HDFS, Github API, LinkedIn API, GoogleMaps API, Node.js, Express, Bootstrap, Chart.js, Mocha and Chai for testing, and AngularJS.  To help with the tesing and deploying the application, we used Jenkins. Github was used to share/link all of our files, which allowed us to all work together.</p>

        <h2 class="page-header text-center">Thanks</h2>
        <p id="about">We would like to thank all of the people at Data Works who have helped us along the way with this project, especially David Mezzetti, Dennis Pereira, James Stuart, and Joe Schweitzer.  We cannot thank Data Works enough for this AMAZING opportunity.</p>
